    If you don't already have it, get required Software... install Git, Django (v1.3 or higher should work), and Python (I think v2.7):
        If you are using Ubuntu, you can use the Ubuntu Software Center or Synaptic Package Manager to get them.
        Else install from websites:
            https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/install/
            http://www.python.org/getit/
            http://git-scm.com/
    Clone source code from git@github.com:nhvtgd/Mentor_Match.git using git in a terminal
        Tutorial: http://gitref.org/creating/
    Change directories to MentorMatch/MentorMatch... There should be a manage.py file in this directory
    Run the server using "python manage runserver" command
    If you see:

    "
    Validating models...

    0 errors found
    Django version 1.X.X, using settings 'MentorMatch.settings'
    Development server is running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
    "

    ...You should be good to go. Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in a browser and the website should work
